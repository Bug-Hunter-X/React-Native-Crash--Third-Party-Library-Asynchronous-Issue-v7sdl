The solution involves using `setImmediate` or similar techniques to ensure that UI updates are always performed on the main thread. This guarantees that the React Native framework can properly handle changes, preventing crashes.

Example (Corrected):

```javascript
// Correct usage using setImmediate
NativeModule.performLongRunningTask().then(() => {
  setImmediate(() => {
    this.setState({ data: 'updated' }); // Now safe
  });
});
```

It might be necessary to adjust the solution depending on the specific third-party library and its API.  Always consult the library's documentation for guidance on asynchronous operations and UI updates.
