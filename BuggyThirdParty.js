This error occurs when you are using a third-party library that doesn't properly handle the asynchronous nature of React Native.  The library might try to update the UI directly from a background thread, which is forbidden. This often happens when using native modules or bridging to native code.  The exact symptom depends on the library, but frequently it presents as a seemingly random crash or unexpected behavior.  Sometimes, the app runs for a while before the error happens, making it harder to debug.

Example (Illustrative):

```javascript
// Incorrect usage of a hypothetical native module
NativeModule.performLongRunningTask().then(() => {
  this.setState({ data: 'updated' }); // ERROR: This might cause a crash
});
```
